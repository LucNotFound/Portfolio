            Hi, Im John Hyacinth V. David currently studying at Lyceum
            Northwestern University <br />
            as an IT. I am actually aiming to be a security engineer in the
            future. I am currently single <br />
            and am planning to focus on my studies instead of having a lovelife.
            My hobbies are playing games <br />
            watching animes and movies, I also listen to music and play guitar,
            and if I feel like it, I act like <br />
            a broken hearted person.
          </h3>
